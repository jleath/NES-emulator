An emulator for the Nintendo Entertainment System written in C.

Work in Progress
So far, I am working on the MOS 6502 cpu emulation.
 * Addressing modes have been Impliedlemented, but not yet fully tested.
 * Operations are not fully Impliedlemented, the file *ops.txt* lists all the operations

Once work is complete on the cpu emulation, I'll begin working on a testing program
that will use a variety of existing test roms to ensure the cpu is emulated properly.

Once the cpu emulation is complete, I have to emulate the PPU, mappers, cartridge/controller input, etc.

So far, the code should be able to be compiled on any platform. When I get to graphics,
I will be using SDL (or something similar) so the program should remain usable on most operating systems.
